# SPEC-Lab-Work
Scripts created for SPEC lab. I worked on the Taulus team as an intern where my team worked to clean datasets, create codebook entries, and create both data visualizations and regression tables.
I include two different scripts that contain code for cleaning datasets: renaming variables, dropping observations, adding labels, removing duplicate entries, renaming countries to match codebook, and saving new datasets.
Data cleaning scripts incldue comments to help describe the changes made to the dataset.
Additionally, I include a script for chloropleth maps over the amount of missing data by index and country 
Lastly, I include a sript with the code for updating a regression table script worked on by a previous intern.
